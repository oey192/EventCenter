/event create <name>

Automatically runs /event select <name> for the event that was just created

Deletes an event. This command must be entered twice for security

/event remove regions <name>
Deletes regions associated with an event. This should be run before an event is deleted as it will not function afterwards

/event info <name>

/event tp <name> [spawnpoint]
Teleports the player to the default spawn point for an event. If a spawnpoint is specified, the player is teleported to that spawn point for the event instead. The player must specify the name of a team for that event or "spec" to teleport to. Anything else will result in the command failing

/event select <name>
Selects an event to set various properties
"none" can be used to deselect the current event. Note that this means no event can be called "none"

/event confirm <name>
Confirms that the player who enters the command will be running the event at its designated start time. This command can be used up to an hour in advance of the scheduled start time of an event. If it is used outside this time frame, it will return an error. It will likewise return an error if the event does not have a scheduled reoccurring time

/event start <name>

If there are teams, this divides the players up as evenly as possible onto appropriate teams

This command must be entered twice for security

Ends the current event (whether it was in the queue or not) and goes to the next event in the queue. This command must be typed in twice for confirmation

/event queue bcast [time]
Alerts the server that the next queued event will begin in 5 minutes, or, if [time] is specified, in [time] minutes. This will not actually cause that event to start at that time
(aliases: /event queue announce [time], /event queue broadcast [time])

Adds <player> to a list of people allowed to run the event

/event remop <event> <player>

/event region set <worldGuardRegionName>
Sets the main encapsulating region for the event
This will fail if the event has any sub regions

/team <team> ignorescramble (on|off)
If autoscramble is on for the event, this team will be excluded from any scrambling of teams
Running /team <team> ignorescramble will disable scrambling for the specified team. /team <team> ignorescramble off will enable auto-scrambling for the team

/team <name> additem <quantity> <itemID|itemName>

/event <regionName> add <flagName> ['win'] [points]
Add <flagName> to the event. If "win" is specified, the event will be considered over when this flag triggers and the player or team that triggers the flag will win the event
If points are specified, that number of points will be given to the player that triggers the flag. Negative points are allowed

/event <regionName> setwin <flagName> [yes|no]
Yes or no is optional. If neither is present, yes is assumed.
Makes <flagName> a winnning flag if "yes", makes it a normal flag if "no"

This throws an error if there are more or less than 2 teams or if autoscramble is on for the event or any team

$2 may be used to represent the name of the player or block effected by the event
Color codes may be used in the message (e.g. &4, &e, etc)


e.g. &9$1 has dropped $2
e.g. &e$1&r has killed &8$2


























Event Notes

General

Need support for tournament based play. E.g. elimination, etc
Way to remove all armour and/or items from players at the beginning of event (and if new player join partway through)
Should also have default set of items to give to all players upon event start and defualt set of items to auto-set as armour (this may make it not necessary to tie in with hat plugin as noted below)
Should be player configurable - EC sets default item set and another set of possible items and player can choose e.g. via command
Tie in with hat plugin to auto set a hat per team color to each player if there's more than one team
Is it possible to cause a lapis block to have the armour value of a diamond helmet?

if no item set is found for an event, clear all participant's inventories

Allow option to repeat appropriate actions from above upon respawn (if allowed)

Look into Vanilla teams - ?

Should be able to constantly make it day in event world during events (or perhaps always?)

Player death events of people who are in events should only be displayed to people in the event

Should prevent players of the opposing team from entering enemy spawn(s)

ECs will need to be able to specify which colors they want used for teams
But there should also be a way for the plugin to pick randomly


tie in with WE - have saved copy of world to reset to at beginning of round - useful for CTF (replaces flags) and breakaway (replace ice)

Make spawn point for ECs in case they need a control room (e.g. Deathrun)


Can we disable Friendly fire? And make this configurable per event?

Add/remove certain permissions to/from people when they are playing an event (likewise remove the permissions from them when they stop playing and/or join Spec)

Can we disable the plugin that stops people from picking up other people's items in the event worlds and/or in certain event regions?

Add ability to have timers separate from general round timer


Need ability to set sub-regions that cause a player to "die" (aka respawn)
Perhaps have ability to set a respawn point per death pit?

Need to have sub-region that causes win when player enters it

EC should be able to set a maximum number of player winners when there's only one team (e.g. Deathrun, Evil Race)


May need the ability for events to cause actions such as switch player from team A to team B
e.g. if re-implementing prop-hunt

EC needs command to announce stuff to server as well as people in events
Perhaps just /bcast and then event specific?

Is it possible to cause a redstone event to happen when EC types /event start ?

Perhaps add a lobby spawn, or just make the lobby area the spec area


events that will need to be listened for (flags)

Lever flicking
Player death
Player whacked
Player dropped item
distance from starting location - ?
PVP-enabked/disabled
friendly-fire on/off
various potions to apply to players
can an event cause a potion?
prevent all damage in this region (incl. fall damage???)





CTL



Evil Race


Breakaway


Prophunt
Is it possible to disable one team from causing any PVP damage at all?
Announce how many people are left upon death
e.g. when less that 5 people are still props, start listing how many people are left whenever someone dies
e.g. when there are less than X seconds left in the round, start listing how many people are left when time remaining is announced


Capture the Flag
Is it implausible to make subregions for green areas that would restrict bow usage to those areas?


Royal Rumble
Need ability to keep track of dominations





Todo:
investigate WorldGuard
perhaps just add my own flags instead of making own flag system
