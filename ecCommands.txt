"none" can be used to deselect the current event. Note that this means no event can be called "none"

Color codes may be used in the message (e.g. &4, &e, etc)

e.g. &9$1 has dropped $2
e.g. &e$1&r has killed &8$2


























Event Notes

General

Need support for tournament based play. E.g. elimination, etc
Way to remove all armour and/or items from players at the beginning of event (and if new player join partway through)
Should also have default set of items to give to all players upon event start and defualt set of items to auto-set as armour (this may make it not necessary to tie in with hat plugin as noted below)
Should be player configurable - EC sets default item set and another set of possible items and player can choose e.g. via command
Tie in with hat plugin to auto set a hat per team color to each player if there's more than one team
Is it possible to cause a lapis block to have the armour value of a diamond helmet?

if no item set is found for an event, clear all participant's inventories

Allow option to repeat appropriate actions from above upon respawn (if allowed)

Look into Vanilla teams - ?

Should be able to constantly make it day in event world during events (or perhaps always?)

Player death events of people who are in events should only be displayed to people in the event

Should prevent players of the opposing team from entering enemy spawn(s)

ECs will need to be able to specify which colors they want used for teams
But there should also be a way for the plugin to pick randomly


tie in with WE - have saved copy of world to reset to at beginning of round - useful for CTF (replaces flags) and breakaway (replace ice)

Make spawn point for ECs in case they need a control room (e.g. Deathrun)


Can we disable Friendly fire? And make this configurable per event?

Add/remove certain permissions to/from people when they are playing an event (likewise remove the permissions from them when they stop playing and/or join Spec)

Can we disable the plugin that stops people from picking up other people's items in the event worlds and/or in certain event regions?

Add ability to have timers separate from general round timer


Need ability to set sub-regions that cause a player to "die" (aka respawn)
Perhaps have ability to set a respawn point per death pit?

Need to have sub-region that causes win when player enters it

EC should be able to set a maximum number of player winners when there's only one team (e.g. Deathrun, Evil Race)


May need the ability for events to cause actions such as switch player from team A to team B
e.g. if re-implementing prop-hunt

EC needs command to announce stuff to server as well as people in events
Perhaps just /bcast and then event specific?

Is it possible to cause a redstone event to happen when EC types /event start ?

Perhaps add a lobby spawn, or just make the lobby area the spec area


events that will need to be listened for (flags)

Lever flicking
Player death
Player whacked
Player dropped item
distance from starting location - ?
PVP-enabked/disabled
friendly-fire on/off
various potions to apply to players
can an event cause a potion?
prevent all damage in this region (incl. fall damage???)





CTL



Evil Race


Breakaway


Prophunt
Is it possible to disable one team from causing any PVP damage at all?
Announce how many people are left upon death
e.g. when less that 5 people are still props, start listing how many people are left whenever someone dies
e.g. when there are less than X seconds left in the round, start listing how many people are left when time remaining is announced


Capture the Flag
Is it implausible to make subregions for green areas that would restrict bow usage to those areas?






Todo:
investigate WorldGuard
perhaps just add my own flags instead of making own flag system
